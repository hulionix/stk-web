				Stackoza is a programmer and artist from Cairo and currently based in Berlin. He views code as a creative tool and an artistic medium through which ideas are expressed and exhibited. He enjoys making <a href="/artworks">artworks</a> showing surreal/abstract aesthetics, and incorporating code/procedural techniques in modeling and texturing through his process. His interest in arts began with drawing, then moved towards a digital direction right after trying Microsoft Paint for the first time in 98. Over the years he worked with several creative apps in the graphics and sound domains, focusing on evolving his style and techniques, and studying these apps from the technical and usability perspectives. He is intrigued by the magical act of creation and the enabling super powers technology can give us. His interests translated to studying and graduating with a bachelor's degree in software engineering, focusing on new media technologies from both the programmer and artist points of view.
