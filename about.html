				Stackoza is an artist/programmer from Cairo and currently based in Berlin. He makes <a href="/artworks">artworks</a> with surreal/abstract aesthetics while incorporating procedural techniques in his process. His interest in arts and technology began with drawing, then moved towards a digital direction right after laying his hands on a pc with Microsoft Paint, wanting to remake an adidas poster he saw earlier, he tries, and the result is far off anything he liked about the poster, nevertheless there was great pleasure. He is intrigued by the magical act of creation and the enabling super powers technology can give us. Few years forward, a friend shows him a fake together with celebrities photo they made with Photoshop, the possibilities he saw in it were bottomless, taking him into a deep dive in the creative apps domain. His interests translated to studying and graduating with a bachelor's degree in software engineering, focusing on new media technologies from both the artist and programmer points of view.
